  "description": "You cause a violent fungal explosion in a 10-foot radius sphere at a point you choose. Each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure: They take 4d8 necrotic damage as rotting spores burst from beneath their skin. If a creature dies from this, it immediately rises as an undead under your control. The area becomes heavily obscured, as thick, toxic spores linger until the spell ends.",
